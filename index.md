## Test

### Gratitude
- Thank you for being here early before service for this meeting! Know it makes for short afternoons. Thad, time to do this, time to do that, nope! Food, nap, head back
- Thank you for working with us on getting Planning Center setup as the central ministry information system here at the church. 
	- Without your help, things would not be flowing as well as they do! It's a bit of a pain to learn some new system that who knows how long we're going to use it. 
	- I've been using Planning Center for 10 years at this point and this has been the best implementation I've seen. 
	- We're still using just about half the capabilities of this software.

### Why an attendance report?
- Record Keeping in Scripture
	- This is not foreign to scripture at all
	- Whole book of numbers where the people are numbered, the army is numbered
	- In the early church there were records of those who were baptized, added to the church. Although they had to do some rounding with the explosive growth of the early church.
	- Meet some of those record-keepers in heaven
	- We're always aiming to do all things decently and in order.
- Encouragement
	- I'm always excited to see our attendance report, not for numbers sake, but because it's a reflection of the ministry that is taking place on any given week
	- One of our highest days in October on the 8th
- Reminder of our Care Strategy
	- The better records we have, the better we can care for people
	- What do I mean by care? Knowing people, having personal contact with people, and the ability to organize ministry to people.
	- The tricky part of where we are right now is that as we run about 200 people on any given Sunday, it's increasingly difficult for everyone to know everyone. When everyone knows everyone, the size of the group can pretty naturally assure care.
	- But where we are and as God sends people, we're figuring out how we can organize care and build a system of care. A system of care may sound impersonal. But **organized care assures care**.
- Reminder of our Discipleship Strategy (Maps to these numbers) Three things we ask of every person part of this church
	- Gather in Worship 
	- Grow in Groups 
	- Serve on a team

### How do we get these numbers?
- Group attendance
	- Entry Methods
		- Email
		- Church Center App
	- Doing great adding leader notes! It's another one of the highlights for me to look and see who's new that we're ministering to.
	- If you need to get someone else setup to take attendance, see me! Typically it's someone who's set as a group leader, but Planning Center introduced a new feature where you can assign group members to help take attendance.
- Kids Check-in
	- Label system for security
	- But also for good records
	- Volunteers, thank you for checking in, please continue to do so! It's also so important for a new parent to come in and see you name-tag.
- Head-counts
	- Chuck Littlefield counting in the auditorium each week

### Groups Strategy
- Why focus on groups?
	- Care - Foundational to care, praying for one another, meeting needs, having friends
	- Discipleship - Bible teaching, encouragement in spiritual life
	- Outreach 
		- We have outreach focused events
		- But in a big way, most everything we do can have a component of outreach
		- (Midweek Spanish Group **4 guests**)
- How to encourage groups?
	- Starting Groups
	- Closing the Gap 
		- Starting new teaching series, we want to promote that
		- Stories from your groups

- Create a slide & add to proclaim and potentially the announcement video
- Post a listing on the sign up page
- Update the group events to contain what series they are doing
- Have the LifeGroup teacher share from the stage on Sunday morning about the new series
